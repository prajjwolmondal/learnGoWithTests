# Learn GO with tests

I've been wanting to learn Go for a year or two now, but I never had the time or mental energy to make any real progress. Now that I've been laid off, I have plenty of both! 

When I'm not applying to 100 jobs a day, I'm  focussing some of my time on learning Go. I discovered a great resource for learning Go using TDD ([link](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)), and this repo is meant to record my journey.
